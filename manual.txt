Usage
=====

I   Register

	Registering is done through register.php. It can be accessed via GET or POST
		* GET:  show a form. This is optional and does not have to be the primary way to enter data.
			Instead, you can use a different form on any website which just sends the correct POST data.

		* POST: add the user to the mailing list. formdata must consist of the following:
			* email
			* fullname
			* title
			* status
			* faculty
			* project

II  Manage

	Use list.php to get an overview of registered users.
	Every list entry has a "remove" button, which removes the respective entry.


III Additional API
	Removing is done over remove.php. This is only accessed via POST, and formdata needs to have an 'email' field.
